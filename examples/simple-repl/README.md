Usage instructions:

* Build the repl with `zig build` -- ensure your current working directory is within `zig-luajit/examples/simple-repl`.
* Run the executable with `zig-luajit/examples/simple-repl/zig-out/bin/simple-repl`.
* Use `print()` to make Lua print the value to standard output.
    - The `simple-repl` does not do any output itself.
